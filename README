Within the closure-compiler Google code project (http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/), they have added a couple
of convenience changes to make it easier to use the closure compiler within a Maven project.

1. The closure compiler can be resolved as a maven dependency:</p>
  <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.javascript</groupId>
     <artifactId>closure-compiler</artifactId>
     <version>r916</version>
  </dependency>

2. The provide an ant task in their source tree within the following class:
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/source/browse/trunk/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ant/CompileTask.java">
com.google.javascript.jscomp.ant.CompileTask.java</a>

Unfortunately, to use the compiler within a maven project still requires you to rely on the maven
ant plugin to expose the ant task to your project.

This small project has a goal of providing a native maven plugin that can be declared and used in
maven projects without the ant wrapper, with the hopeful benefit of making the usage pattern
cleaner.
